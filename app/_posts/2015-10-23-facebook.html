        <h1>
            Facebook may be the secret force behind surveillance bill
            &ldquo;CISA&rdquo;
        </h1>

        <p>
            We're hearing that Facebook is secretly lobbying Congress for a
            horrible bill called &ldquo;CISA&rdquo; that would give companies
            impunity for violating their users&rsquo; privacy&mdash;as long
            as they hand over user data to the government. Most tech companies
            are against it for privacy reasons, but apparently Facebook is
            working behind the scenes to make sure it passes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mark Zuckerberg once called Facebook users &ldquo;dumb f*cks&rdquo;
            for trusting him with their data. Now he&rsquo;s testing us. If CISA
            passes, all your photos, posts, relationships, and likes will have a
            path to government databases.

            <h3>
                Tell Facebook to stop backstabbing the Internet and oppose CISA. 
            </h3>

            <div id="petition">
                <span>
                    CISA is an assault on Internet privacy and it will actually make cybersecurity worse, not better. If you care about protecting your customers and preventing future hacks you should make it clear that you oppose CISA and any other attempt to give corporations immunity for negligent security in exchange for handing over data to the government.

        <h2>
            We knew Facebook didn&rsquo;t respect user privacy, but passing a
            new surveillance law in their name is some next level isht.
        </h2>
         <p>
            It didn't make any sense. This bill is toxic. The public hates it and 
            tons of tech companies are against it, but Congress keeps trying to ram
            it through. Now that we're hearing that Facebook lobbyists are trying to
            get it passed, we know why it keeps coming up. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Facebook&rsquo;s chief Senate lobbyist, Myriah Jordan,
            worked for Senator Richard Burr, the senator who is sponsoring CISA,
            right until taking the job at Facebook. These &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo;
            connections give companies more power and influence than ordinary
            people could ever have, and it&rsquo;s part of the reason why
            companies like Facebook think they can get whatever they want out of
            Washington.
        </p>

        <p>
            Facebook wants CISA because they want protection from privacy
            lawsuits, but if companies like Google, Twitter, and Apple can do
            the right thing, Facebook can too.
