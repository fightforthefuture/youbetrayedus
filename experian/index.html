    <h1>Experian's security negligence put millions at risk of identity theft.<em>Now they're lobbying Congress to get off the hook.</em></h1>
    <p>
        Experian should have used basic security practices to protect our data; they didn't. Now, 15 million T-Mobile customers’ sensitive information has been stolen by identity thieves. And this isn't the first time. In fact, Experian has been breached more than 100 times. But instead of improving their security, Experian is spending millions lobbying Congress to pass CISA, a bill that could give them total legal immunity when they get hacked, as long as they share your personal information with the government. If they get away with it, we’ll never be able to hold companies accountable when their negligence puts our safety and privacy at risk. We need to draw a line in the sand, right now.

    <h2>CEO Brian Cassin puts his profits above your safety by funding political corruption.</h2>
    <p>
        Under Cassin's leadership, Experian has spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress
        through cash donations and Political Action Committees. They've pushed legislation that would
        <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/04/15/why-this-national-data-breach-notification-bill-has-privacy-advocates-worried/" target="_blank">weaken data breach notification regulations</a>.
        Their top recipients in the House of Representatives all voted in favor of
        <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1560">PCNA</a>,
        a spying bill that would allow them to share customer information with the
        government. And now they're supporting CISA, a bill that could
        <a href="https://www.decidethefuture.org" target="_blank">broadly allow them to violate their privacy agreements</a> with customers and get
        immunity for leaking peoples' information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Brian Cassin has put the profits of his company above the well-being of his customers.
        His strategy is simple&mdash;by giving enough money to politicians, those politicians
        will hopefully pass legislation allowing him to duck responsibility for keeping his
        customers' data secure. Why bother improving their security when they can just
        legislate their way out of the messes they make?
    </p>
    <h3>But what's wrong with CISA?</h3>
    <p>
        CISA is not a real cybersecurity bill. It puts American citizens under more
        mass surveillance and opens up the doors to even more foreign cyber attacks.
    </p>

<section class="whats-wrong">
    <ul class="copy">
        <li>
            All privacy policies effectively null and void. Companies can share any
            private user data with the government, without a warrant, as long as
            the government says it is being used for a “cybersecurity” purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            In exchange, companies are given blanket immunity from civil and criminal
            laws, like fraud, money laundering, or illegal wiretapping (if a
            violation was committed or exposed in the process of sharing data).
        </li>
        <li>
            Data is shared with a wide array of government agencies, from the FBI
            and NSA, to the IRS and local law enforcement. Many of these agencies
            have been breached within the last year and have outdated security systems,
            opening up the doors to even more cyber attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Companies that play along can get otherwise classified intelligence data
            from the government, including private information about their competitors.
