        <h1>
            Facebook may be the secret force behind surveillance bill
            &ldquo;CISA&rdquo;
        </h1>

        <p>
            We've gotten information that Facebook is secretly lobbying for a
            dirty bill called &ldquo;CISA&rdquo; that would give them
            impunity for violating their users&rsquo; privacy&mdash;as long
            as they hand over user data to the government. Most tech companies
            are against it for privacy reasons, but apparently Facebook is
            working behind the scenes to make sure it passes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mark Zuckerberg once called Facebook users &ldquo;dumb f*cks&rdquo;
            for trusting him with their data. Now he&rsquo;s trying to take advantage of us. If CISA
            passes, all your photos, posts, relationships, and likes will have a
            path to government databases.
        </p>

            <h3>
                Facebook, are you backstabbing the Internet? Come clean on CISA now.

            <div id="petition">
                <span>
                    CISA is an assault on privacy and it will actually make cybersecurity worse, not better. If you care about your customers you should make it clear that you oppose CISA and any other attempt to give corporations immunity for negligent security in exchange for handing over user data to the government.

        <h2>
            We knew Facebook didn&rsquo;t respect user privacy, but passing a
            new surveillance law in their name is some next level isht.
        </h2>
         <p>
            It didn't make any sense. This bill is toxic. The public hates it and tons of tech companies are against it, but Congress keeps trying to ram it through. Now that we know that Facebook lobbyists are working behind the scenes to get it passed, it makes more sense why Congress keeps coming back to it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Facebook&rsquo;s chief Senate lobbyist, Myriah Jordan, worked as General Counsel for CISA's sponsor, Senator Richard Burr, right up until taking the job at Facebook. On her lobbying disclosures she lists &ldquo;cybersecurity&rdquo; as one of the issues she's been discussing with senators. These &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; connections give companies more power and influence than ordinary people could ever have, and it&rsquo;s part of the reason why companies like Facebook think they can get whatever they want out of Washington.
        </p>
         <p>
            Several offices on the Hill have heard from Facebook that they support CISA. As much as we wish we could reveal our sources, we agreed not to (selective leaking is part of how the lobbying game works, unfortunately). But this information matches with everything we know about Facebook's love for CISA over the years. They backed the bill loudly before it was unpopular and then stayed silent as other big tech companies came out against it. We've asked them to state their position publicly, but they have said nothing. Facebook has backed this from day one, and now they're the lone tech voice still working to make sure it passes. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Facebook wants CISA because they want immunity from privacy lawsuits, but if companies like Apple, Twitter, and Reddit can do the right thing by their users and oppose CISA, Facebook can too.

    <ul class="copy">
        <li>
            All privacy policies effectively null and void. Companies can share any
            private user data with the government, without a warrant, as long as
            the government says it is being used for a “cybersecurity” purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            In exchange, companies are given blanket immunity from civil and criminal
            laws, like fraud, money laundering, or illegal wiretapping (if a
            violation was committed or exposed in the process of sharing data).
        </li>
        <li>
            Data is shared with a wide array of government agencies, from the FBI
            and NSA, to the IRS and local law enforcement. Many of these agencies
            have been breached within the last year and have outdated security systems,
            opening up the doors to even more cyber attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Companies that play along can get otherwise classified intelligence data
            from the government, including private information about their competitors.
